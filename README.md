# SpringPlayground

Exploring Spring Boot through practical backend experiments.

## Overview
SpringPlayground is a personal learning project to deepen backend development skills using the Spring Boot framework.  
It starts with small, focused exercises and grows into a mini-ecosystem of APIs, integrations, and cloud-ready services.

The goal: gain practical, job-ready experience with the tools and patterns common in modern Java backend roles.

## Current Progress
- ✅ Environment setup (VS Code + Spring Boot extensions)
- ✅ First REST endpoint with query parameters
- ✅ Basic YAML configuration

## Planned Learning Path
1. **Core Spring Boot**  
   - REST controllers, request mappings, and JSON responses  
   - Dependency Injection (DI) and component scanning  
   - DTOs and input validation

2. **Data Layer**  
   - Integrating MySQL with Spring Data JPA  
   - CRUD operations and repository patterns  
   - Query optimization basics

3. **Caching & Messaging**  
   - Redis for caching  
   - Kafka for event-driven communication

4. **Advanced Topics**  
   - MongoDB integration  
   - Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)  
   - Logging, monitoring, and alerts

5. **Project Completion**  
   - A fully functional backend with multiple data sources, caching, messaging, and clean architecture

## Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Maven
- Lombok
